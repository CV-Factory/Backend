## üìñ Overview

This repository contains the backend server for the CVFactory project.
It's designed for processing and extracting information from web pages and other text sources, particularly for generating content like CVs.
The server handles API requests and performs several key operations:
- **Web Scraping/Crawling**: Utilizes Playwright to dynamically fetch and render web pages, enabling the extraction of content even from JavaScript-heavy sites. It can recursively navigate through iframes to gather comprehensive HTML data, as seen in tasks like `extract_body_html_recursive`.
- **HTML Parsing**: Employs BeautifulSoup to parse the fetched HTML, allowing for targeted extraction of text and structured data.
- **Text Processing**: Includes functionalities for cleaning and formatting extracted text, preparing it for further use or storage.
- **Background Task Management**: Leverages Celery with Redis as a message broker to manage these potentially long-running operations (scraping, parsing, formatting) asynchronously, ensuring the API remains responsive.
- **Large Language Model (LLM) Integration**: Incorporates Google's Gemini API (via `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` in Langchain) to generate application-specific text, such as cover letters. The LLM is prompted with contextually relevant information to produce desired outputs.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Implements a RAG pipeline using Langchain to enhance the LLM's context understanding for tasks like cover letter generation. This involves:
    - Loading job posting text (e.g., from `logs/` directory).
    - Chunking the text (e.g., using `SemanticChunker` or `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`).
    - Generating embeddings for these chunks using Cohere (via `CohereEmbeddings`).
    - Storing these embeddings in a FAISS vector store for efficient similarity searches.
    - Retrieving relevant text chunks based on user queries or task requirements and providing them as augmented context to the Gemini LLM, enabling more informed and relevant text generation.

The overall goal is to automate parts of the CV and cover letter creation process by intelligently extracting information and leveraging generative AI.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Conda (for running cover letter generation script)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `CVFactory_Server` directory.
3. (Optional) Create and activate a Conda environment for the cover letter generation script:
```bash
conda create -n cvfactory_env python=3.10 -y
conda activate cvfactory_env
pip install google-generativeai langchain langchain-community faiss-cpu cohere python-dotenv langchain-experimental langchain-google-genai langchain-cohere --upgrade
```
4. Build and run the Docker containers:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This command builds the Docker image (installing Python dependencies and Playwright browsers as defined in the `Dockerfile`) and then starts three services:
- `redis`: The Redis server for Celery.
- `web`: The FastAPI web server, handling API requests.
- `worker`: The Celery worker, processing background tasks.

## üñ• Usage

The FastAPI server will be accessible via the port mapped in the `docker-compose.yml` file (default: `8001`). You can interact with the defined API endpoints to initiate tasks. Tasks are processed asynchronously by the Celery worker.

Cover Letter Generation Script:

To run the cover letter generation script using the Conda environment created in the installation steps:

1.  Navigate to the `CVFactory_Server` directory.
2.  Activate the Conda environment:
    ```bash
    conda activate cvfactory_env
    ```
3.  Run the script, specifying the path to the formatted job posting text file in the `logs/` directory:
    ```bash
    python generate_cover_letter_semantic.py
    ```
    The generated cover letter will be printed to the console and saved to `logs/generated_cover_letter_formatted.txt`.

Key Endpoints:
- `POST /`: Initiate the main processing task for a given URL and optional query.
- `POST /launch-inspector`: Launch Playwright inspector for a URL (useful for debugging scraping).
- `POST /extract-body`: Initiate task to extract `<body>` HTML from a URL, including flattening iframes.
- `POST /extract-text-from-html`: Initiate task to extract text content from a saved HTML file in the `logs` directory.
- `POST /format-text-file`: Initiate task to reformat a text file in the `logs` directory (e.g., wrapping lines).
- `GET /tasks/{task_id}`: Check the status and result of a submitted Celery task.

Logs and extracted files will be saved to the `logs/` directory, which is mapped as a volume in `docker-compose.yml`.
